# HEXAProjects

First go at using HEXA.

Skills created to test the capabilities of Go, C++, Python and ROS in conjunction with the MIND SDK.

Ultimate goal is to produce a skill that subscribe the HEXA to a ROS publisher that outputs joint and time information in an array. 

Adapted the example skill for moving the legs to make it remote controlled using a web page. This tested the hexabody framework.

Adapting the example ROSSkill to publish different types of messages worked.

Tested TCP capabilities.

Rosserial test worked.

Cgo test worked.

Adapting the publisher layout to create a subscriber.

Using cgo to work between the Go code and the C++ ROS node.

Adapted subscriber to work with arrays.
